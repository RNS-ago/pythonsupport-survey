## Request flow

| Part | Folder | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | [`frontend/`](../frontend/) | Static HTML, CSS and JavaScript modules. No build step. |
| Backend | [`backend/`](../backend/) | Django app with a PostgreSQL database (SQLite in local development). Stores responses and problem logs, checks the supporter password, issues links and QR codes, and hosts the admin site. |
| Deployment | [`deploy/`](../deploy/) | Scripts and config for setting up and updating the server. |

```

DTU runs nginx on the server, with the certificate for `https://psqdb.compute.dtu.dk`. It
forwards every request to `http://127.0.0.1:2810`, where Django answers all of them,
including the frontend files (see `backend/pythonsupport/pythonsupport/urls.py`). The
nginx side is described in [nginx](nginx.md).

The frontend and the API are served from the same address, so the frontend calls the
API with relative URLs (`apiBase = ""` in `frontend/js/config.js`). No cross-origin
requests are needed.

## Supporters

1. The supporter opens the site and enters the daily code. The frontend sends it to
   `POST /api/csrf/`. If it matches `SURVEY_PASSWORD`, the backend marks the session as
   authorized and returns a CSRF token. The session cookie lasts 24 hours.
2. The frontend keeps the token in `localStorage` and sends it as the `X-CSRFToken`
   header on every later request.
3. The supporter chooses a form:
   - **Customer Satisfaction**: pick a building, then the student fills in the survey.
     It is sent to `POST /api/responses/`.
   - **Internal Logging**: tick common problems or describe another one. It is sent to
     `POST /api/problem-logs/`.
4. If the backend is unreachable, the supporter can continue without a code: survey
   responses are queued on the device and uploaded once the backend answers and the code
   has been entered. Problem logs are not queued.

## Students

Students never log in. A supporter creates a link for them:

| Supporter action | Endpoint | Link | Valid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Discord link" button | `POST /api/links/` | `?token=…` | 24 hours, one use, building recorded as `Online` |
| "QR" button | `POST /api/qr-codes/` | `?t=…` | 1–365 days, reusable, fixed building |

The student's survey posts to `POST /api/responses/` with the link's token in the body
instead of a session. The backend decides the building from the token.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Who | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/csrf/` | anyone with the password | Log in; returns the CSRF token |
| `POST /api/responses/` | logged-in supporter, or a student with a link token | Save a survey response |
| `POST /api/problem-logs/` | logged-in supporter | Save a problem log |
| `POST /api/links/` | logged-in supporter | Create a one-time link |
| `POST /api/qr-codes/` | logged-in supporter | Create a reusable QR link |
| `/admin/` | Django staff accounts | Browse and export the data |

The Analytics page in the frontend embeds a Power BI report; it does not read from this
backend.
